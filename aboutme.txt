It all started when I was around 7-8 years old. I played DDR(Dance Dance Revolution) for the first time. And I loved every single part of it. Without DDR my life would not be the same, I probably wouldn't like anime, Japan, music, and every thing that makes me, well me. So thanks Konami for your game. It may seem silly that my DDR changed my life but it did and I still play it to this day.
